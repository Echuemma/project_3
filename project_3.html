            <h2 id="first-post">How I Started Coding</h2>
            <p>My journey into programming began about a year ago. I was always fascinated by how websites and apps worked, and I decided to dive into learning HTML and CSS. It was challenging at first, but with time, I started to enjoy building simple web pages.</p>
            <p>I remember my first project: a personal webpage with a photo of myself, some text, and links to my favorite sites. It wasn’t much, but it felt like a huge accomplishment!</p>

            <h2 id="second-post">What I Learned This Week</h2>
            <p>This week, I learned about CSS Flexbox, which helps create layouts that adjust to different screen sizes. It’s amazing how just a few lines of CSS can make your site look so much better and more responsive. I also started learning JavaScript, which adds interactivity to web pages. It feels like I’m opening a whole new chapter of my coding journey!</p>
            <p>Next week, I plan to dive deeper into JavaScript and build a simple calculator.</p>
